# CapitalQuiz
Capital Quiz is a quiz/trivia game created using Swift UI and following the MVVM architecture. Players have 20 seconds to answer 13 questions about European countries. I wanted the code I wrote to be as clean and simple as possible, so I implemented the MVVM architecture. The application includes all the game logic, a timer, animations, and the ability to replay the entire gameplay. The user can only proceed to the next stage after guessing the question.
